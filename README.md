### [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) ðŸŽ„

Started learning a little bit of python earlier this year for some raspberry pi
experiments. Thought it'd be a good challenge solve AOC in this newer language
for me, after I've solved it each day using Typescript.. to give myself a
chance!
